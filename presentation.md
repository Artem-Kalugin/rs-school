   I want to start my presentation with the statement: «Understanding of computer technologies is very important nowadays».
   So, what is a computer today? Firstly it's an irreplaceble tool
   for the majority of people. The accountant uses computer for
   optimization of company financials, the designer does same for
   comfortable creation of models. And if we speak about programmers,
   we should mention that computer is a main tool of their
   profession. A good computer with correct and clever architecture
   becomes stable and fast, and make performance of any programmer
   better.
   So, what are the main details of a good computer? We can see that
   the biggest part of our computer (if we speak about default
   configuraton, not all in one) is a system block. The other devices
   are computer periphery that makes user expirience better.
   And there are several main parts of a system block that we can see
   inside: Motherboard is a nervous system of the computer. It contains a lot
   of connection ports to organize computer details and force them to
   work together. If you want to choose good middle-level motherboard
   you should pay attention to this features: form factor, socket,
   ram type, pci slots and their types, hard drives connections, and
   other different things: wifi, bluetooth, ethernet, usb and other.
   Now I will describe it more detailable:
   The form factor depends on ur system block construction. The most
   common form factors nowadays is mATX and ATX. mATX is minified
   version of ATX, so u can use both types in system block with ATX
   form factor. The choise of socket will decide the CPU which will be able to work
   with ur motherboard. CPU is a central proccesor unit, but i will
   call it just proccesor. There are two different companies that
   produces computer proccesors nowadays: AMD and Intel.This proccesors
   are almost equal, but the amd seems to be cheaper and have better
   price-quality ratio. By the same way, intel more secure and have
   better ux. The generation of proccesor will also be based on socket
   u choose. The main rule is to buy proccesors that not older than 5
   years. Nowadays proccesors become more complex and there are no
   features that more important than other, except techprocces. So u
   should choose proccesor with the help of benchmarks and reviews. The
   proccesor makes overall expirience of computer usage better, the ide
   and chrome runs faster, the compiling of programs take less time,
   the system animations become more beautiful and smooth. In other
   words the proccesor is a brain of the computer.
   Now i would like to tell you about RAM. RAM is a random access
   memory. This memory proccesses diffirent launched applications In
   real time. The heavier the application, the more memory you need.
   The main rule is RAM generation or DDR. DDR is double-data-rate,
   and, obviously it means that next gen DDR will work twice faster
   that current one. Nowadays the latest DDR version is 5. The average
   RAM amount for middle level computer is 8 or 16gb. The more RAM u
   have the more blanks your google chrome will process at the same
   time without reloading.
   The pci is Peripheral Component Interconnect. So we use PCI slots
   for connecting with components that need fast speed and big
   throughput. The main usage of pci slots nowadays is a videocard.
   Videocard is a computer component that proccess video infromation
   and provide great computing power for computer graphic.
   Unfortunately the videocard is not so important for programmers,
   it’s more about gamedev, gamers, and cgi engineers. So nowadays
   videocard that integrated in u CPU will be enough for average
   computer using.
   Hard drives. Computer uses hard drives to store the static
   information that shouldn’t be proccesed in a real time. It’s your
   programm source files, family album images, audio files, different
   notes and etc. there are two main types of hard drives today: SSD
   and HDD. SSD provides big speed and less store in comparison to HDD.
   In other words SSD makes you programs and system alaunch faster. The
   average amount of hard drive memory that u need today is 1 or 2 TB.
   PSU. PSU is a power supply unit. It's an important component, that
   provides electricity to other components. PSU has different voltage
   and amperage levels for every detail. And of course PSU has power.
   literally power is a resource that gives u opportunity to connect
   devices to computer. So, if ur components need more power that PSU
   can provide this computer will be unstabled.
   Fans are also valuable part of the computer. As u can know, the
   computer components can heat up to 100 celsium degrees. It's can be
   dangerous sometimes. And of course it's shortens life time of
   computer. So we need something that will cool our components. Fans
   are the most spreaded device that can help us. We have 2 different
   types of fans: CPU fan and case fan. Two most valuable qualities is
   noise and tdp. TDP is a thermal design power, it indicates what temperature your fan can withstand. So u should make sure that fan that u choose fit ur system properly/
   Most of remaining computer divices are computer periphery. Computer
   periphery connects with other parts via motherboard interfaces such
   as usb. They are not important, but some of them can be very comfortable to use. And of course there are a lot of special things such as: printer, scaner, tv tuner, bluetooth module, wifi module etc. The most popular periphery devices is mouse, keyboard, monitor, external hard drive, headphones. So, we know what is CPU. It's a brain of our computer. But, how did it connects with other components? Well, our motherboard has 2 structures called South and North bridges. It's an integrated circuits that connects different components together. So, firstly wehave a FSB or frontal side bus that connects CPU with northbridge. U can see that northbridge also connected with PCI-E ram and southbridge. So CPU pcie and ram have the fastest connection. After it we have southbridge that connects all other devices. The speed of southbridge connection is lesser than north one. However since 2008 literraly all CPUs have northbridge placed inside, not on motherboard. So, this scheme is a little bit legacy but still good to understand connection.So, it were basics of computer architecture. Hope u enjoyed and all information was understandable.
