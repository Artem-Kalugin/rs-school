              So, what is a computer today? Firstly it's an irreplaceble tool
              for the majority of people. The accountant uses computer for
              optimization of company financials, the designer does same for
              comfortable creation of models. And if we speak about programmers,
              we should mention that computer is a main tool of their
              profession. A good computer with correct and clever architecture
              becomes stable and fast, and make performance of any programmer
              better.

              So, what are the main details of a good computer? We can see that
              the biggest part of our computer (if we speak about default
              configuraton, not all in one) is a system block. The other devices
              are computer periphery that makes user expirience better.

              Motherboard is a nervous system of the computer. It contains a lot
              of connection ports to organize computer details and force them to
              work together. If you want to choose good middle-level motherboard
              you should pay attention to this features: form factor, socket,
              ram type, pci slots and their types, hard drives connections, and
              other different things: wifi, bluetooth, ethernet, usb and other.
              Now I will describe it more detailable:

            <aside class="notes">
              The form factor depends on ur system block construction. The most
              common form factors nowadays is mATX and ATX. mATX is minified
              version of ATX, so u can use both types in system block with ATX
              form factor.

            <li>
              <p>Brain of the computer</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>AMD or Intel?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Pay attention to the generation and techprocces</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes">
            The choise of socket will decide the CPU which will be able to work
            with ur motherboard. CPU is a central proccesor unit, but i will
            call it just proccesor. There are two different companies that
            produces computer proccesors nowadays: AMD and Intel.This proccesors
            are almost equal, but the amd seems to be cheaper and have better
            price-quality ratio. By the same way, intel more secure and have
            better ux. The generation of proccesor will also be based on socket
            u choose. The main rule is to buy proccesors that not older than 5
            years. Nowadays proccesors become more complex and there are no
            features that more important than other, except techprocces. So u
            should choose proccesor with the help of benchmarks and reviews. The
            proccesor makes overall expirience of computer usage better, the ide
            and chrome runs faster, the compiling of programs take less time,
            the system animations become more beautiful and smooth. In other
            words the proccesor is a brain of the computer.

            Now i would like to tell you about RAM. RAM is a random access
            memory. This memory proccesses diffirent launched applications In
            real time. The heavier the application, the more memory you need.
            The main rule is RAM generation or DDR. DDR is double-data-rate,
            and, obviously it means that next gen DDR will work twice faster
            that current one. Nowadays the latest DDR version is 5. The average
            RAM amount for middle level computer is 8 or 16gb. The more RAM u
            have the more blanks your google chrome will process at the same
            time without reloading.

          </ol>
          <aside class="notes">
            The pci is Peripheral Component Interconnect. So we use PCI slots
            for connecting with components that need fast speed and big
            throughput. The main usage of pci slots nowadays is a videocard.
            Videocard is a computer component that proccess video infromation
            and provide great computing power for computer graphic.
            Unfortunately the videocard is not so important for programmers,
            it’s more about gamedev, gamers, and cgi engineers. So nowadays
            videocard that integrated in u CPU will be enough for average
            computer using.

            Hard drives. Computer uses hard drives to store the static
            information that shouldn’t be proccesed in a real time. It’s your
            programm source files, family album images, audio files, different
            notes and etc. there are two main types of hard drives today: SSD
            and HDD. SSD provides big speed and less store in comparison to HDD.
            In other words SSD makes you programs and system alaunch faster. The
            average amount of hard drive memory that u need today is 1 or 2 TB.

            PSU. PSU is a power supply unit. It's an important component, that
            provides electricity to other components. PSU has different voltage
            and amperage levels for every detail. And of course PSU has power.
            literally power is a resource that gives u opportunity to connect
            devices to computer. So, if ur components need more power that PSU
            can provide this computer will be unstabled.

            Fans are also valuable part of the computer. As u can know, the
            computer components can heat up to 100 celsium degrees. It's can be
            dangerous sometimes. And of course it's shortens life time of
            computer. So we need something that will cool our components. Fans
            are the most spreaded device that can help us. We have 2 different
            types of fans: CPU fan and case fan. Two most valuable qualities is
            noise and tdp. TDP is a thermal design power, it indicates what
            temperature your fan can withstand. So u should make sure that fan
            that u choose fit ur system properly/

            comfortable to use. And of course there are a lot of special things
            such as: printer, scaner, tv tuner, bluetooth module, wifi module
            etc. The most popular periphery devices is mouse, keyboard, monitor,

            So, we know what is CPU. It's a brain of our computer. But, how did
            it connects with other components? Well, our motherboard has 2
            structures called South and North bridges. It's an integrated
            circuits that connects different components together. So, firstly we
            have a FSB or frontal side bus that connects CPU with northbridge. U
            can see that northbridge also connected with PCI-E ram and
            southbridge. So CPU pcie and ram have the fastest connection. After
            it we have southbridge that connects all other devices. The speed of
            southbridge connection is lesser than north one. However since 2008
            literraly all CPUs have northbridge placed inside, not on
            motherboard. So, this scheme is a little bit legacy but still good
            to understand connection.
